My implementation of a Pathtracing Renderer using a few different resources, including the [Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) Book.
It also supports loading 3D Models with diffuse, roughness and normal maps.

The render result is saved into an OpenGL texture which is then rendered onto the screen.
